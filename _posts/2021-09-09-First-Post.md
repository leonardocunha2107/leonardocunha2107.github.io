title: "I finally created my page!"
---

Hi anyone that's reading! I just graduated and thought it was about time to be all professional looking and create a webpage for myself.  
As I'm writing this, I'm in Montreal finishing my amazing internship in [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/). This has been an amazing experience in an amazing place (did you know it's the biggest AI lab in the world?) surrounded by amazing people that come from such diverse places I've often felt myself in a college brochure or in a joke's intro.  
I've done my internship on [Average-Case Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04756), a fascinating area of research in Optimization mixing Random Matrix Theory, which was one of my favorite course in my master's back in France, and first-order methods which are ubiquitous throught machine learning.  
I've made my 'memoire' available on this site right [here](http://leonardocunha2107.github.io/files/Rapport_de_Stage.pdf). If the french system made any sense this would be my master thesis. We'll be submitting a polished version  to a conference real soon,and I'll be trying to publish a version of this repport as a survey in this interesting field, but if you're real hasty or just an acquaintance I directed here to get a sense of the kind of things I do, please take a look.    
Among other things, I'm really grateful I was advised by the amazing [Fabian Pedregosa](http://fa.bianp.net/pages/about.html), [Courtney Paquette](https://cypaquette.github.io/), [Damien Scieur](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=hNscQzgAAAAJ&hl=fr) and my incredible internship supervisor [Gauthier Gidel](gauthiergidel.github.io).
