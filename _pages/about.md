Hey you! My name is Leonardo Cunha and this is my weird mix between a professional and personal page.  
I hold a Master's degree from École Polytechnique, where I've pursued my broad interests in Mathematics and Machine Learning.  
I've worked on Optimization, Varational Autoencoders and a bit of NLP.  
As of the moment I'm writing this my academic interests are on Deep Learning Theory and the ill-defined field of Geometric DL.   
I've just graduated! (u.u)  and I'm taking a little break right now, but I'm excited to work on impactful products where my ML expertise can be helpful. Drug Discovery, Generative Design and  knowledge management NLP systems are some of the things I'd love to work with.
If you have a job, my profile interests you and you've somehow found this page, give me a shoutout.
